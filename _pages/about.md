Hello! My name is Li Ze. I’m currently pursuing a Doctor of Philosophy in Biological Science at [Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST)](https://www.naist.jp/en/) under the guidance of [Professor Okamura Katsutomo](https://bsw3.naist.jp/eng/courses/courses216.html) at NAIST. My research interests span a wide spectrum of **non-coding genome-related topics**, specifically focusing on the small RNA biogenesis pathway and functions, nuclear-cytoplasmic transport, and RNA binding proteins. In 2020, I obtained a Master's degree from [Northwest A&F University (NWAFU)](https://www.nwsuaf.edu.cn).
